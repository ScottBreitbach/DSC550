The project for this course is to develop your own original analysis case study, and you will be working through and updating this project for the remainder of the term. The work you are doing on the Titanic case study in parallel is a guide for your original project, but you will need to adapt the analysis for your data/project."

There are lots of ideas available online through Kaggle and other sources, but your idea should have a unique spin on it. The second step is locating your data. This can come from a variety of sources, e.g., Kaggle, your job, a website, API, etc. Feel free to reach out to your instructor if you are not sure if your idea and data are suitable."
